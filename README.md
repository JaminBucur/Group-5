## Description
Weather to Wear is an application that would tell users what to wear based off their location and closet. The clothing in the closet would have a heat index and based on that would choose the best fit. The motivation for this app is to enable users with the best and most suitable apparel based on the weather and temperature. The goal of this app is to recommend suitable clothing to match the weather. Also, to keep the user warm or cool. It will be in Java language. With the app you will be able to login and signout, add and delete clothing, add temperature score to clothing, creation of a closet, advertising, scheduling of sales, and commenting.
Eliminate the choice from your day. Have the Auto-Fit select the best most suitable apparel for the day. The app will automatically choose the best clothing to wear based on the weather. Also, it allows for advertisements that help the user fill their closet with clothes. And no need to worry about inapropiate ads or comments since there is an Administrator that approve the ads and filter the comments.
